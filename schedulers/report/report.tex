\begin{abstract}
In this report I will be analysing the effects of 4 different scheduling algorithms: First In First Out, Shortest Time Remaining, Round Robin \& Lottery Schedulers. During my experiments, I will be conducting tests on different sized datasets and then analysing different aspects of the environment, such as Idle time, Context switching and mean time for an average job.
